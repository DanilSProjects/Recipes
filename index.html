        <p>Welcome to Nonna Maria's collection of recipes!</p>
        <img src="./images/chef2.jpg" height=200 alt="Cartoon Italian chef presenting dish.">
        <p>All of these recipes are collected from over 50 years of Nonna Maria's cooking experience, gathered from all over Italy (with Nonna Maria's Sardinian touch). Please take a look and enjoy!</p>
        <p>Note: this website does not contain all of Nonna Maria's recipes, because trying to convert all of her notebook entries into webpages would take many, many years. Please consult her directly if you wish to borrow a specific recipe not listed here.</p>
