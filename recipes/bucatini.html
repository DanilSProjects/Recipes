        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nonna Maria's mamma always used to say, that pasta wasn't pasta if the chef didn't use bucatini. This is a recipe that all the big Roman mafia chefs wanted to keep secret from the public. Luckily, Nonna Maria infiltrated their main hideout in her youth and got this amazing recipe for a classic all'amatriciana pasta, as well as 4.2 million lira.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>170g guanciale, cut into slices about 1/8 inch thick and then into 3/4- by 1/4-inch strips</li>
            <li>pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>60ml dry white wine</li>
            <li>794g whole peeled tomatoes, hand-crushed</li>
            <li>kosher salt (it's healthier, you know?) and freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>450g bucatini pasta</li>
            <li>30g grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add guanciale and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add wine and cook, scraping up any browned bits on bottom of pan, until nearly evaporated, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, boil pasta in salted water until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute less than package recommends. Using tongs, transfer pasta to sauce, along with 1/4 cup pasta cooking water. Cook over high heat, stirring and tossing rapidly, until pasta is al dente and sauce has thickened and begins to coat noodles. Remove from heat, add cheese, and stir rapidly to incorporate. Season to taste with more salt and pepper. Serve right away, passing more cheese at the table.</li>
