        <h1>Nonna's Risotto Recipe</h1>
        <img src="../images/risotto.jpg" height=300>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My Georgio always talks to Nonna Maria about this show "H*ll's Kitchen" starring Scottish chef Giuseppe Rossi. Nonna Maria typically does not approve of shows containing coarse language and sacrilegious imagery, but this show is very good. Chef Rossi often asks his contestants to either cook beef wellington or risotto for the opening of the restaurant. Very good choice! Risotto is a very popular Italian rice dish that many of Nonna Maria's readers might have already tried and enjoyed. Now you can learn how to create your own using Nonna's expertise!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth </li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>4 tbsp butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups arborio rice</li>
            <li>kosher salt (it's healthier, you know?) and freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped chives</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. finely chopped basil</li>
        </ul> 
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium pot, combine water and broth and bring to simmer.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large straight-sided skillet over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir rice into onion mixture and season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until rice is lightly toasted, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour wine into rice mixture and bring to a boil. Cook, until almost evaporated, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and pour a few ladlefuls of warm broth into skillet and cook, stirring gently until broth is absorbed. Continue to cook, repeating adding a few ladlefuls of broth and stirring until broth is absorbed before adding more, until rice is al dente, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove skillet from heat and stir in remaining 2 tablespoons butter, lemon juice, and Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Top with chives and basil and more Parmesan before serving.</li>
        </ol>
